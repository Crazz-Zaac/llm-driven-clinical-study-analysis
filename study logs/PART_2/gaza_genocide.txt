Gaza genocide
The Gaza genocide is the ongoing, intentional, and
Gaza genocide
systematic destruction of the Palestinian people in the
Gaza Strip carried out by Israel during the Gaza war. It Part of the Gaza war, the Israeli occupation of
encompasses mass killings, deliberate starvation, the Gaza Strip, and the Israeli–Palestinian
infliction of serious bodily and mental harm, and conflict
prevention of births. Other acts include blockading,
destroying civilian infrastructure, destroying healthcare
facilities, killing healthcare workers and aid-seekers,
causing mass forced displacement, committing sexual
violence, and destroying educational, religious, and
cultural sites.[16] The genocide has been recognised by
a United Nations special committee [17] and
commission of inquiry,[16] the International
Association of Genocide Scholars,[18][19] multiple
human rights groups,[c] numerous genocide studies and
international law scholars,[25][26] and other experts.[27]
By October 2025, the Gaza Health Ministry had
reported that at least 66,148 people in Gaza had been
killed.[28] The vast majority of the victims were
civilians,[29][30] and around 50% were women and
children.[31][32] Compared to other recent global
conflicts, the numbers of known deaths of journalists,

Perpetrator Israel
Israel and its supporters maintain that its actions do not
constitute genocide.[49][55] The Israeli government Litigation South Africa v. Israel
maintains that its military actions were a response to Nicaragua v. Germany
the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on Israel and that it
sought to destroy Hamas and free Israeli hostages.[56][49][57] There is increasing consensus among
genocide and international legal scholars on the genocide assessment,[25] though some academics
challenge it.[58][59]
Background
Israel's occupation of the Gaza Strip began in 1967. In 2005, Israel withdrew its ground forces in the
context of the Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada.[60] The International Court of Justice subsequently
issued an advisory opinion that despite the withdrawal Israel is still illegally occupying the Gaza Strip.[61]
Since 2007, the Gaza Strip has been governed by Hamas, an Islamist militant group, while the West Bank
remained under the control of the Palestinian Authority. After Hamas took over, Israel intensified its
blockade of the Gaza Strip, citing security concerns;[62][63] international rights groups have called the
blockade a form of collective punishment.[64][65][66] UNRWA reported that, due to the blockade, 81% of
Gazans were living below the poverty level in 2023, with 63% food insecure and dependent on
international assistance.[67][68] Since 2007, Israel and Hamas (and other Palestinian militias in Gaza) have
engaged in conflict,[63][69][70] including four wars in 2008–2009, 2012, 2014, and 2021.[71][72]
On 7 October 2023 Hamas led an attack into Israel from
Gaza,[73][74][75] killing at least 1,139[76][77][d] people, most of
them civilians.[84] The attack included grave acts of violence,
including sexual violence.[78] During the attack, Palestinian
militant groups abducted 251 people from Israel to the Gaza
Strip.[85] Israel responded with a highly destructive[86]
bombing campaign followed by an invasion of the Gaza Strip
on 27 October.[87]
Hamas officials said the attack was a response to the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank, the blockade of Gaza, Israeli
settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the
movement of Palestinians, and the detainment of thousands of
Palestinians, many without charges, whom Hamas sought to
release by taking Israeli hostages.[88][89][90] Numerous
commentators have identified Israeli occupation as a cause of
the war.[91] Several human rights organisations, including
Amnesty International,[92] B'Tselem,[93] and Human Rights
A September 2023 United Nations map of
Watch,[94] have likened the Israeli occupation to apartheid;

affirmed the occupation as illegal and said it violated the illustrating the geographic scope of the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of preexisting blockade and the physical

During the first 48 hours of Israel's retaliatory attack, IDF
chief Herzi Halevi reported that the IDF attacked 1,000 targets. According to his wife, he told her that
"Gaza will be destroyed". Reportedly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu subsequently said he wanted
5,000 targets to be attacked, even though the IDF had not confirmed 5,000 enemy targets. Artificial
intelligence was used to generate a list of targets, in many cases based on unconfirmed or outdated
intelligence. About 10,000 Palestinians were killed in a month, including entire families. Shmuel
Lederman called this "as criminal as it gets".[98]
The Israeli government has said that the military actions it has undertaken are in response to the October
7 attacks and sought to destroy Hamas, overthrow its governance of the Gaza Strip, and free Israeli
hostages. It has denied that its military operations constitute genocide.[56][49][57] Multiple commentators
argue that part of the motive is retaliation for the 7 October attacks.[99][100][101] Nimer Sultany argues
that anti-Palestinianism is also a motive.[102]
Definitions of genocide and legal challenges
The 1948 United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed "with intent to
destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group", and as such, "causing harm,
preventing births, and forcibly transferring children".[103][104] The International Court of Justice has
never held a state liable for genocide.[105] The legal threshold for genocidal intent remains a major barrier
to prosecution.[105]
The original definition coined by Raphael Lemkin was broader than that used by the Genocide
Convention and included cultural and social destruction. In contrast, orthodox scholarly definitions
emphasise actions targeting a group's physical survival.[106][107] No minimum number of
victims[108][109][110] or intended victims[111] is required to establish the crime, nor is complete destruction
of the group.[112] In the Rohingya genocide case, several states contended that the ICJ should "adopt a
balanced approach that recognizes the special gravity of the crime of genocide, without rendering the
threshold for inferring genocidal intent so difficult to meet so as to make findings of genocide near-
impossible."[113]
Genocidal intent and incitement
Experts affirm that statements by Israeli political and military
leaders[114][115][116]—coupled with eliminationist media
rhetoric and Israel's conduct in Gaza—indicate genocidal
intent and incitement against the Palestinian people in
Gaza.[116] Israeli officials and journalists[114][117][118] have
made verbal statements that dehumanise Palestinians and
incite, justify, or praise atrocities against them as a
group.[119][120] Genocidal intent is also evidenced by the
scale and systematic nature of actions that exceed any
Palestinians under the rubble after Israeli
legitimate military objective[121][116]—including the
bombing of the Gaza Strip
extensive targeting of children,[56][116] widespread sexual
violence,[122] destruction of cultural heritage,[123][124][125]
and imposition of life-destroying conditions[126][127]—together with the persistence of these practices
despite awareness of their catastrophic effects.[128][129]
Both a United Nations commission of inquiry and Amnesty
International documented a "pattern of conduct" by Israeli "I have ordered a complete siege
authorities, concluding that genocidal intent is the "only on the Gaza Strip. There will be no
reasonable inference" that can be drawn from the electricity, no food, no fuel,
evidence.[133][134] Other organisations that have attributed everything is closed. We are
genocidal intent to the actions or statements of Israeli officials fighting human animals, and we
include a United Nations panel [117][135] and Genocide are acting accordingly."[e]
Watch.[136][137] As part of Defense for Children International –
– Yoav Gallant, Minister of Defense of
Palestine v. Biden, the historian Barry Trachtenberg said that
Israel, on 9 October 2023[130][131][132]
the rhetoric used by Israeli officials underlies the consensus
among genocide historians that the situation in Gaza constitutes
genocide.[120] Navi Pillay, the chair of the UN commission of inquiry, compared the statements of Israeli
politicians to the genocidal incitement during the Rwandan genocide.[138]
In September 2025, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, president Isaac Herzog, and former
defence minister Yoav Gallant were found by a United Nations commission of inquiry to have engaged in
"direct and public incitement to commit genocide".[139] Israeli leaders' repeated references to Amalek —
the biblical enemy of Israelites whose annihilation is commanded by God — have been considered
evidence of genocidal intent by many critics,[140][141] including South Africa.[142][143]
Onset
B'Tselem, the South African case against Israel, and some scholars who argue Israel is committing
genocide argument give 7 October as its start date.[144][145][146] According to B'Tselem, "The genocidal
assault on the residents of Gaza, and on all Palestinians as a group, cannot be understood without
acknowledging the impact of the 7 October attack on Israeli society. The shock, fear and humiliation
elicited by the attack, and the societal upheaval it triggered, served as a driving force for a shift in
government policy toward the Palestinians—from oppression and control to destruction and
annihilation."[78] Martin Shaw and A. Dirk Moses argue that this "front-loaded violence" makes it harder
to argue that the genocide began after the initial Israeli attack on Gaza.[147][148]
On 13 October 2023, the historian Raz Segal said Israel was committing a "textbook case of genocide".
He was one of the first scholars to do so.[149] Others argue that the war was initially legitimate and the
genocide started later, in 2024 or 2025.[147][148] In September 2024, a UN Special Committee concluded,
"the policies and practices of Israel during the reporting period [i.e. October 2023 to July 2024] are
consistent with the characteristics of genocide."[150]
Genocidal acts
Direct killings
UN experts and human rights organisations have characterised Israel's actions in Gaza as
extermination,[151] a crime against humanity that involves "the act of killing on a large scale". During the
first two months of bombing, Israel dropped 25,000 tonnes of explosives on the Gaza Strip. Many of
these were unguided bombs dropped in densely populated areas, obliterating entire neighbourhoods.[152]
Since 7 October 2023, the IDF has been accused of extrajudicial killing of unarmed Palestinians[153][154]
and healthcare personnel.[155] Israeli soldiers have killed Palestinian civilians, with a December 2023 UN
report stating that they allegedly shot them in front of their families.[156] In January 2024, Israeli soldiers
shot at civilians waving white flags, killing one.[156][157] Doctors have identified numerous Palestinian
children with single gunshot wounds to the head and chest, consistent with intentional targeting by Israeli
forces.[158]
In April 2024, mass graves were found containing over 300 corpses,[159][160] allegedly including older
people, women and wounded,[160] and others with their hands tied.[160] The IDF said accusations that it
caused the killings were "baseless and unfounded",[161] and that during its operation "in the area of
Nasser Hospital, in accordance to the effort to locate hostages and missing persons, corpses buried by
Palestinians in the area of Nasser Hospital were examined."[162] It added, "Bodies examined, which did
not belong to Israeli hostages, were returned to their place."[162][163]
At least 14,000 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza by December 2023.[164] In late 2024, a study limited
only to those fatalities confirmed by at least three independent sources, and only from November 2023 to
April 2024 (about 8,100 people), corroborated previous reports by the UN and news outlets that 70% of
fatalities were women and children.[165][f] As of 31 August 2024, data from the Ministry of Health (only
for those of the dead who were fully identified, about 34,000 people at the time) showed that 60% of

Hospital after Israeli airstrike in the Nuseirat refugee camp, Gaza Strip
those killed were women, children, and the elderly.[167] Eleven months later (31 July 2025) the number of
those of the dead who were fully identified reached 60,199, 52.6% of whom were women, children, and
the elderly.[168][169][g]
By 14 January 2024, over 23,900 Gazans had been confirmed killed.[170] By 10 May, deaths had topped
35,000, a third of them unidentified, with over 10,000 more estimated to be buried under the rubble.[171]
Within the first three weeks, the Israeli assault killed more children in Gaza than were killed worldwide
across all conflict zones in any year since 2019.[172][173] Over 52,000 people had been wounded by
December 2023,[174][175] and by May 2024 this number had risen to over 77,700.[176][177]
As of 10 October 2025, the Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least 67,194 Gazans were killed, which is
between 3% and 4% of Gaza's total population.[178]
+972 Magazine and Local Call reported that the IDF decided early in the war to authorise killing up to 15
to 20 civilians per low-ranking militant, while for a senior militant killing more than 100 civilians was
authorised. An intelligence officer said that Israel was not interested in killing Palestinian operatives in a
military context only, but preferred to bomb them in their family homes, saying "It's much easier to bomb
a family's home" where they are easier to target.[179] Another intelligence officer said that in targeting
junior militants, Israel used only dumb bombs, which can destroy entire buildings, to not "waste
expensive bombs on unimportant people".[180]
In March 2024, Haaretz reported that some Israeli commanders had set up "kill zones" in which soldiers
were commanded to kill anyone on sight, even if they were unarmed.[181][182] According to an Israeli
officer, "in practice, a terrorist is anyone the IDF has killed in the areas in which its forces
operate."[181][h]
In June, the Associated Press found that Israel's campaign in Gaza was killing entire bloodlines of
Palestinians to a "degree never seen before".[184] According to testimony given to the Israeli Knesset,
Israeli soldiers driving armoured bulldozers had been ordered to "run over terrorists, dead and alive, in
the hundreds".[185]
The proportion of women and children among the dead is disputed,[186][187] but the names, gender, and
age of 60,000+ of the victims are known and published.[188] On 7 May 2024, total deaths quoted by the
UN were 34,735, of which 24,686 are fully identified: 52% women and children, 8% elderly of all
genders, and 40% men.[186] In November 2024, the UN published an analysis covering 8,119 fatalities
that were verified by at least three independent sources, between November 2023 and April 2024, with
70% of them women and children.[189] As of 31 August 2024, per the Gaza Ministry of Health, the
number of fatalities had risen to 40,691, 34,344 identified by name: 17,652 (51%) women and children,
2,955 (9%) elderly of all genders (defined as those aged 60 or older), and 13,737 (40%)
men.[190][167][191] A year later (31 July 2025), per the Gaza Ministry of Health, the number of fatalities
identified by name reached 60,199: 28,728 (48%) were women and children, 2,928 (5%) were elderly of
all genders (defined as those aged 65 or older), and 28,543 (47%) were men. A minimum of 18,457
children had been killed since October 2023.[188] In November 2024, the Gaza Health Ministry reported
that 1,410 Gazan families had been completely erased from the civil registry as a result of Israeli
bombings.[192] Data collection has become increasingly difficult for the Gaza Health Ministry due to the
destruction of infrastructure.[171] The ministry has had to supplement its usual reporting based on hospital
dead with other sources of information,[171] including reports by the media and first responders as well as
families and widows, who must formally register their husbands' deaths to qualify for government
assistance.[193] Professor Mike Spagat found an urgent need for a transparent methodology to reconcile
its top-line death numbers—34,535 as of 30 April 2024—with its detailed breakdowns, including only
those of the dead who were fully identified, summing to 24,653 on the same date.[31] By August 2025,
this gap between the number of victims and the number of fully identified vicitms became smaller (about
62,000 vs. about 60,000), as more victims were identified.[194] The ministry's figures for the total number
killed have been contested by Israeli authorities but accepted as accurate by Israeli intelligence services,
the UN, and the World Health Organization.[171] More recently, The Guardian has reported that a
classified IDF database registered 8,900 killed militants. This and GHM's data imply a civilian death rate
of 83%, which exceeds that of any conflict since 1989 except the Rwandan genocide, the Siege of
Mariupol, and the Siege of Srebrenica.[195] The IDF denied this, saying the figures were inaccurate and
inconsistent with its data.[196]
A 2025 paper on the Gaza war estimated 64,260 deaths from traumatic injury between October 2023 and
30 June 2024, and likely exceeding 70,000 by October 2024, with 59.1% being women, children and the
elderly. It concluded that the GHM undercounted trauma-related deaths by 41% in its report, and also
noted that its findings "underestimate the full impact of the military operation in Gaza, as they do not
account for non-trauma-related deaths resulting from health service disruption, food insecurity, and
inadequate water and sanitation."[197] A comparable estimate for traumatic injury deaths was around
80,000 for January 2025.[198] A February study in The Lancet estimated that life expectancy in the Gaza
Strip between October 2023 and September 2024 decreased by 34.9 years, excluding indirect deaths. The
study also used census and registration data to assess the reliability of the Gaza Health Ministry's death
count, and found no substantial errors.[199]
In May 2025, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich claimed that Israel was targeting Hamas's civilian
workers, saying, "We're eliminating ministers, bureaucrats, money handlers—everyone who holds up
Hamas's civilian rule."[200] Killing civilian members of Hamas is in itself illegal.[201]
Starting in June 2025, IDF soldiers said they were ordered to shoot at crowds of Palestinians near Gaza
Humanitarian Foundation aid sites,[202] killing over 1,000 people.[203] Amnesty International alleged
Israel was trying to restrict aid to starve and inflict genocide upon the Palestinians.[204]
In November 2025, a study by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research estimated that the
total number of violent deaths in Gaza was between 100,000 and 126,000, of which 27% were children
under 15 years old, and 24% women.[205][206][207]
Indirect deaths
Rasha Khatib, Martin McKee, and Salim Yusuf published an
estimate of the number of deaths, directly or indirectly caused
by the conflict, that as of July 2024 had already occurred or
would occur in the coming months and years. Indirect
Palestinian deaths from disease are expected to be much
higher due to the intensity of the conflict, destruction of
healthcare infrastructure, lack of food, water, shelter, and safe
places for civilians to flee, and reduction in UNRWA funding.
They estimated that the total conflict-related deaths in Gaza
Mother cries for her 4-year-old daughter,
will likely be four to 16 times higher than the reported death
who died due to malnutrition and lack of
toll. By multiplying the reported deaths by five, they argued treatment
that "186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the
current conflict in Gaza".[171] Spagat wrote that their estimate
"lacks a solid foundation and is implausible",[208][209] but it was "fair to call attention to the fact that not
all of the deaths are going to be direct violent ones", and has called the death toll in Gaza "staggeringly
high".[186][209] Donald Bloxham also notes that most deaths have been "indirect deaths" in various wars
and that the "systematic obstruction of supplies into Gaza" is an Israeli policy, which makes calling these
deaths "indirect" incorrect.[210]
An October 2024 letter by US healthcare workers who had served in Gaza since 7 October 2023 tried to
estimate the number of Gazans who had died of starvation based on publicly available IPC reports.[211] It
said the most conservative estimate was that at least 62,413 people in Gaza had died from starvation,
most of them young children; this estimate was based on the assumption that catastrophic (level 5) food
insecurity results in a death rate of at least 2 deaths per 10,000 people per day.[i] The physicians also
estimated that at least 5,000 people had died from lack of access to care for chronic diseases.[212][213][214]
The indirect death estimates in two studies reviewed by The Economist implied that the life expectancy in
Gaza has fallen by 35 years, rivalling the Rwandan genocide in absolute terms.[215][216]

In February 2024, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International both released statements declaring
Israel had failed to comply with the ICJ's 26 January ruling to prevent genocide by blocking aid from
entering Gaza.[53][52][217] A Refugees International report found that Israel had "consistently and
groundlessly impeded aid operations within Gaza".[218] The historian Melanie Tanielian argues that
starvation and blockade should be foregrounded as methods of genocide alongside mass bombing.[219] In
an April report, B'Tselem called the unfolding famine "the product of a deliberate and conscious Israeli
policy".[220][221]
In October 2023, the World Food Program warned of Gaza's dwindling food supply,[222] and in
December, alongside the UN, it reported that more than half of Gaza's population was "starving", fewer
than one in ten were eating every day, and 48% were suffering "extreme hunger".[223][224][225] Palestinian
Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki referred to "Israel's deliberate use of starvation as a weapon of war
against the people it occupied"; an Israeli official called the charge "blood-libellous" and
"delusional".[226] In December 2023, Human Rights Watch found that Israel was using starvation as a
weapon of war by deliberately denying access to food and water.[227] In January 2024, UN experts
accused Israel of "destroying Gaza's food system and using food as a weapon against the Palestinian
people".[228] In February 2024, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich personally blocked US-funded
shipments of flour from entering Gaza, in violation of promises Israel had made to the US
government.[229]
In early 2024, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to food Michael Fakhri said that Israel is
"culpable" of genocide because "Israel has announced its intention to destroy the Palestinian people, in
whole or in part, simply for being Palestinian" and because Israel was denying food to Palestinians by
halting humanitarian aid and "intentionally" destroying
small-scale fishing vessels, greenhouses and orchards in Gaza ... We have never seen a
civilian population made to go so hungry so quickly and so completely, that is the consensus
among starvation experts. Israel is not just targeting civilians, it is trying to damn the future
of the Palestinian people by harming their children.[230]
After the ICJ ruling, the number of aid trucks Israel allowed into Gaza dropped by 40%.[231] In the ICJ's
March reaffirmation of provisional measures, the court highlighted the "unprecedented levels of food
insecurity experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip over recent weeks, as well as the increasing risks
of epidemics",[232] acknowledging that since the Court's January order there had been a "lack of Israeli
compliance" resulting in "the catastrophic living conditions" deteriorating further.[233]
In March 2024, 12 Israeli human rights organisations signed an open letter accusing Israel of failing to
abide by the ICJ ruling to prevent genocide by facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid.[234][235] In
April the UN special rapporteur on the right to health Tlaleng Mofokeng said Israel was "killing and
causing irreparable harm against Palestinian civilians with its bombardments", adding, "They are also
knowingly and intentionally imposing famine" and accusing Israel of "genocide".[236]
In October 2024, Israel had reportedly adopted a modified version of the Generals' Plan.[237][238][j] The
proposed plan included orders for all residents of northern Gaza to leave within a week; a full siege on
water, food, and fuel; and then the arrest or killing of all who remained.[240][241] By mid-October 2024,
Israel had ordered the evacuation of northern Gaza and prevented the entry of humanitarian aid for almost
two weeks.[242][243] According to Stephen Devereux, avoidable deaths due to starvation as a result of
Israeli policies "almost certainly constitutes a war crime and a crime against humanity".[244]
On 21 November 2024, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant, asserting that the two "bear criminal
responsibility for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare".[245][246][247]
Israel lifted restrictions on aid into Gaza in January–February 2025 during the first stage of the January
ceasefire. But on 2 March, Israel announced that all humanitarian aid would be blocked indefinitely
unless Hamas agreed to alter the terms of the ceasefire deal, which Hamas refused to do.[248][249] Within
four days, food supplies in Gaza had rapidly depleted while the price of food had more than doubled. Aid
agencies such as Oxfam and UNICEF warned of mass starvation if the aid freeze continued. Oxfam
policy lead Bushra Khalidi predicted "the total collapse of systems that sustain life".[250] Lawyer Salah
Abdel-Ati said Israel's actions were illegal under the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits the
destruction or withholding of essentials such as food in combat zones.[251]
In May 2025, after blocking the import of all food, medicine, and fuel for two and a half months,[252]
Netanyahu announced that Israel would allow "minimal humanitarian aid" into Gaza due to international
pressure.[200] Israel has proposed using private companies to distribute aid to the south of Gaza only. The
plan is backed by the US, which has created the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to deliver aid
without "Hamas stealing, looting or leveraging this assistance for its own ends". The United Nations aid
chief Tom Fletcher criticised the plan, saying it "forces further displacement" and "makes aid conditional
on political and military aims".[253] Numerous Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while
approaching GHF aid distribution points.[254]
In August 2025, it was reported that Israel planned to surge aid to other parts of Gaza while cutting off all
aid to Gaza City to force residents to evacuate while Israel takes over the city.[255] As of August 2025,
projections show the entire population is experiencing "high levels of acute food insecurity", with about
641,000 people experiencing catastrophic levels.[39] The IPC confirmed famine is taking place in the
Gaza Governorate.[39][256]
Two weeks after the October 2025 ceasefire came into effect, dozens of NGOs, including the Norwegian
Refugee Council and Doctors Without Borders, announced that Israel was arbitrarily blocking their
shipments of aid to Gaza. World Health Organisation head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, "the
situation still remains catastrophic because what's entering is not enough" and "there is no dent in hunger
because there is not enough food".[257][258]

Mark Levene and Elyse Semerdjian locate the mass destruction of infrastructure within Israel's Dahiya
doctrine, implemented against Gaza since 2006, with Levene calling it urbicide and a tool of
genocide.[259][260] In October 2024, Forensic Architecture concluded, "Israel's military campaign in Gaza
is organised, systematic, and intended to destroy conditions of life and life-sustaining infrastructure".[261]
In July 2025, The Guardian reported that "about 70% of the structures in Gaza are either completely
destroyed or severely damaged". Israel was reportedly paying contractors up to 5,000 shekels per
building demolished.[262] In February 2025 it was reported that at least 15 children had died of
hypothermia over the winter due to Israel's destruction of housing and power facilities.[263] In May 2025,
Netanyahu said, "we are destroying more and more homes, and Gazans have nowhere to return to. The
only inevitable outcome will be the wish of Gazans to emigrate outside of the Gaza Strip."[264]
In a December 2024 report, Human Rights Watch accused Israel of committing acts of genocide in Gaza
by targeting water and sanitation infrastructure and depriving Palestinians of adequate access to water.
The report alleges that Israel intentionally damaged solar panels powering treatment plants, a reservoir,
and warehouses, while blocking repair materials and fuel for generators, cutting electricity supplies, and
attacking workers.[265][266] According to B'Tselem, Israel has destroyed 84% of Gaza's water
facilities,[267] while in a report authored and published by the World Bank, European Union, and United
Nations it was reported that 89% of Gaza's water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities had been destroyed or
damaged.[268] UN Special Rapporteur Pedro Arrojo-Agudo called these attacks "an important part of a
genocidal strategy."[269]
Rafah, a city in the southern Gaza Strip, has been razed;[270] this has been mostly carried out by
bulldozing and controlled demolitions of buildings, rather than by aerial bombardment.[271] In July 2025,
the BBC reported that Israel had engaged in controlled demolitions of civilian infrastructure, potentially
in violation of the Geneva Convention.[272] The BBC reported an IDF spokesperson saying, "Hamas and
other terrorist organizations conceal military assets in densely populated civilian areas. The IDF identifies
and destroys terrorist infrastructure located, among other places, within buildings in these areas."[272] In
November 2025, the BBC reported that Israel had demolished over 1,500 more buildings in Gaza since
the ceasefire with Hamas.[273] A spokesperson for the IDF said it was acting "in accordance with the
ceasefire framework" as the demolitions occurred behind the Yellow Line, in the portion of Gaza under
Israeli military control, which comprises 53% of Gaza.[273]
Forced displacement
On 6 October 2024, Israel designated northern Gaza as a combat zone and ordered the civilian population
to evacuate.[274][275] Both Israeli military analysts and the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights alleged
that this was the first stage of the "Generals' Plan", a policy proposed by the former Israeli general Giora
Eiland to force Palestinians out of Gaza.[276]
Human Rights Watch reports that Israel's systematic forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza amounts
to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Since October 2023, Israel's evacuation orders have displaced
1.9 million people—nearly Gaza's entire population—through unclear, inconsistent directives, often
issued amid bombings, leaving civilians with no safe routes or destinations. Humanitarian zones were
repeatedly attacked, while Israel blocked aid, leading to starvation, destroyed infrastructure, and
uninhabitable conditions. Senior Israeli officials openly declared intentions to reduce Gaza's territory and
push Palestinians out, reinforcing policies of ethnic cleansing and permanent displacement.[277][278][36]
The UN Human Rights Office said that Israel may be causing the "destruction of the Palestinian
population in Gaza's northernmost governorate through death and displacement."[279] South Africa and
others have criticised the Gaza Strip evacuations as a key component of the genocide.[280] B'Tselem
mentions statements by Israeli high-ranking officials that a "central objective of the war" was ethnic
cleansing.[264]

Attacks on healthcare and preventing births
Top to bottom:

In November 2023 in The Lancet and in February 2024 in BMJ Global Health, multiple doctors detailed
how the targeting of Gazan health infrastructure and medical personnel, coupled with rhetoric used by
Israeli politicians, amounts to genocide.[281] Legal scholars have supported this assessment.[282][182]
Gaza's healthcare system faced humanitarian crises as a result of Israel's assault: hospitals began shutting
down by 23 October as they ran out of fuel.[283] When hospitals lost power, multiple premature babies in
NICUs died.[284][285][286] Israeli airstrikes have killed numerous medical staffers, and ambulances and
health institutions have been destroyed.[287] Médecins Sans Frontières reported that scores of ambulances
and medical facilities were damaged or destroyed,[288][289] and that its own staff were killed.[290][291] The
Gaza Health Ministry said the healthcare system had "totally collapsed".[292] In April 2024, UN special
rapporteur on the right to health Tlaleng Mofokeng said, "The destruction of healthcare facilities
continues to catapult to proportions yet to be fully quantified."[236]
As of February 2025, at least 160 healthcare workers from Gaza are believed to be detained by Israel,
with another 24 missing after being taken from Gaza hospitals. Al-Shifa hospital director Mohammed
Abu Salmiya, detained for seven months and released without charges, detailed the abuses he faced and
said that in Israeli prisons "no day passes without torture".[293]
In March 2025, a UN investigation concluded that Israel had committed genocidal acts in Gaza by
systematically destroying its reproductive healthcare facilities while imposing a siege preventing
necessary medications for deliveries, pregnancies, and neonatal care, causing "irreversible" harm to
Palestinians' reproductive prospects in Gaza. The commission also found that Israeli forces intentionally
destroyed Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, Al-Basma IVF Centre, which served 2,000 to 3,000
patients a month. Israel destroyed about 4,000 embryos and 1,000 specimens of sperm and unfertilised
eggs in the attack.[294][295] No evidence that the building was used for military purposes was found. The
commission concluded that the destruction of the clinic "was a measure intended to prevent births among
Palestinians in Gaza, which is a genocidal act".[296][297][298] UN experts reported that they had found that
Israel had systematically destroyed women's health care facilities and used sexual violence as a war
strategy, thereby carrying out genocidal acts against Palestinians.[297][298]
Destruction of cultural, religious and educational sites
Amnesty International notes that "while the destruction of historical, cultural and religious property or
heritage is not considered a prohibited act under the Genocide Convention, the ICJ has established that
such destruction can provide evidence of intent to physically destroy the group when carried out
deliberately."[299] The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention has said that Israel's deliberate
destruction of cemeteries in Gaza indicates genocidal intent because it enacts the "erasure of a
people's...historical presence".[124]
Since 7 October 2023, the IDF has been accused of using excessive force against dozens of
schools;[300][301] theft;[302] desecration and mutilation of deceased Palestinians;[155] and making no, or an
inadequate, distinction between Hamas forces and civilians.[303] The targeting of cultural and educational
sites have also been cited as genocidal acts, as has the use of white phosphorus.[k][305]
On 18 April 2024, UN experts in Geneva condemned Israel for its "scholasticide" in Gaza, finding that it
had destroyed more than 80% of schools and killed 5,000 students, 261 teachers, and dozens of
professors.[43]
Clockwise from top:
A mosque in Gaza destroyed in an Israeli airstrike, 20 February 2025. · The wreckage of

Amnesty International identified at least four instances in which there was "no imperative military
necessity" for the deliberate destruction of Gazan cultural and religious sites:[306] the destruction of the
Al-Mughraqa campus of Al-Azhar University, the Al-Zahra campus of Israa University, the Al-Dhilal
mosque and Bani Suheila cemetery in Khan Younis, and the Al-Istiqlal mosque in Khan Younis.[307]
Amnesty International pointed to the attitudes and behaviour of Israeli soldiers involved in the
demolitions of these sites in videos posted on social media as evidence that these actions demonstrated
genocidal intent. Amnesty International also noted the overall volume of destruction of Gazan cultural,
historical and religious sites, including Gaza's central archives.[308]
As of January 2025, Israel had destroyed 815 mosques and 19 cemeteries during the Gaza war.[309]
In June 2025, UN experts published a report saying Israel had committed the crime against humanity of
extermination for "killing civilians sheltering in schools and religious sites". According to the report,
Israel has destroyed over 90% of educational buildings in Gaza.[310]
Serious bodily and mental harm, and sexual violence
The number of injured since 7 October 2023 due to Israeli military actions is greater than 170,000,[5][15]
and Gaza has the most child amputees per capita worldwide.[37] In the same period over 1,000
Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank.[311] Israel has been accused of indiscriminate mass
detentions[312][313] and has been documented making threats of mutilation,[314] death, arson, and
rape,[315] and torturing Palestinians detained without charges.[316] By March 2024, an estimated 17,000
children were "wounded children, no surviving family" (WCNSF), a new medical term.[317][158]
In August 2024, the UN OHCHR reported receiving testimony from Palestinians imprisoned at Sde
Teiman detention camp about rape and sexual assault perpetrated on detainees.[3] The Lemkin Institute
considers this and similar reports to be indicative of "Sexualized Violence During Genocide", or sexual
violence being used to destroy a group.[318]

As of 25 August 2024, the UN estimates that most of Gaza's 2.2 million people are confined to roughly
15 square miles (39 km2), causing a critical lack of basic services, like clean water, and diseases
spreading widely, such as Hepatitis C.[319]
Amnesty International reported that the pattern of abuses inside Israeli prisons "underscores the
systematic dehumanization and mental and physical abuse of Palestinians in Gaza and may also be taken
into account with a view to inferring genocidal intent from pattern of conduct."[320] According to the
Independent International Commission of Inquiry, gender-based and sexual violence were committed "to
dominate, oppress and destroy the Palestinian people in whole or in part."[321] According to a UN
committee, the Gaza war has resulted in disabilities for more than 21,000 children as of September
2025.[38]
Ecocide
Israel's bombing in Gaza caused severe environmental devastation, destroying vegetation, water,
sanitation, and waste infrastructure and contaminating air, soil, and water. The UN and environmental
groups report damage consistent with "ecocide", citing massive debris, untreated sewage, and toxic
pollution. These conditions have triggered disease outbreaks, respiratory illnesses, and long-term health
risks.[322][4][323] Multiple commentators have argued that deliberate ecocide is a central component of
Israel's genocide in Gaza.[324][325][326] Scholars have argued that the destruction of the environment
sustaining a population including its water, land, and food systems constitutes a genocidal act, as it
inflicts conditions of life calculated to destroy the group, in whole or in part.[l][328][329]
Academic and legal discourse
There is a growing consensus among genocide and Holocaust
scholars, international legal experts, human rights
organisations, and governments that Israel's actions in Gaza
constitute genocide. Israel and its supporters deny the
accusation.[331][332][330]

Answers to the question "How would you define Israel's military campaign in Gaza?" among Middle East scholars
in a January–February 2025 survey[330]
Genocide (46.0%)
Major war crimes akin to genocide (36.0%)
Major war crimes but not akin to genocide (9.00%)
Unjustified actions but not major war crimes (4.00%)
Justified actions under the right to self-defence (4.00%)
I don't know (2.00%)
Some scholars say the Gaza genocide is merely the latest stage of a "slow-motion genocide" of
Palestinians that began with the Nakba and the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians upon
Israel's founding in 1948.[333][334][335]
According to B'Tselem and others, the Gaza genocide is occurring in the context of over 75 years of
Zionist settler colonial violence and Jewish supremacy targeting Palestinians.[78][336] Multiple genocide
scholars argue that settler colonialism is an important motive for Israel's actions.[337] Raz Segal and
B'Tselem also highlight the increasing influence of Jewish supremacy in Israeli politics,[338][78] while
reports by Francesca Albanese and Amos Goldberg highlight the project of Greater Israel.[339][340][341]
Genocide and Holocaust studies
In May 2025, NRC wrote that leading scholars in genocide studies are "surprisingly unanimous" that
Israel is committing genocide.[342] Some scholars of Holocaust studies, such as Norman J. W. Goda and
Jeffrey Herf, have said that Israel is not committing genocide.[343] Others, such as Israeli professors Raz
Segal and Shira Klein, have argued that Israel's actions should be analysed as a case of
genocide,[342][344][345] citing, among other things, attacks on infrastructure, food, and water as
genocidal.[346] Omer Bartov, professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University and an
Israel Defense Forces veteran, has said: "intent has been publicly expressed by numerous officials and
leaders. But intent can also be derived from a pattern of operations on the ground, and this pattern became
clear by May 2024".[347] Amos Goldberg and Daniel Blatman, historians of the Holocaust and genocide
studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, noted that "most acts of genocide are perceived by their
perpetrators as acts of self-defense against their victims" and the Gaza war "falls into this category."[348]
On 31 August 2025, the International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), the world's biggest
academic association of genocide scholars, passed a resolution saying that Israel has committed genocide
in Gaza.[18][19][349]
Legal and human rights experts
In December 2023, former International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo told Al
Jazeera that the siege of Gaza was a form of genocide due to Israel's imposing conditions that would lead
to the deaths of Palestinians.[350] In December, in correspondence published in The Lancet, multiple
specialists in international medicine and humanitarian aid reiterated warnings of the risk of genocide,
while detailing how Israel's blocking of humanitarian support and aid were leading to unnecessary deaths,
and how the death rate would continue to worsen. They called on signatories to the Genocide Convention
to enforce a ceasefire on Israel.[351] Nimer Sultany argues that, by mid-2024, a growing consensus among
legal scholars suggested that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.[352] Multiple public declarations
from journals and academic organisations have warned of a potential genocide and declared opposition to
an ongoing genocide.[137][353][354]
In January 2024, a number of prominent Israelis, represented by the human-rights lawyer Michael Sfard,
sent Israel's attorney general and state prosecutor an open letter detailing examples of "the discourse of
annihilation, expulsion and revenge".[355] The signatories said the Israeli judiciary was ignoring
incitement to genocide in Gaza.[355] In January 2024, the American political scientist and international
relations scholar John Mearsheimer wrote that, while he had believed during the first two months of the
war that Israel was "guilty of serious war crimes", once the 2023 Gaza war ceasefire ended, it "became
clear" to him "that Israeli leaders were in fact seeking to physically destroy a substantial portion of Gaza's
Palestinian population".[356] William Schabas, an expert in international criminal law,[357] said that South
Africa's case was the strongest of all recent genocide cases at the International Court of Justice, citing the
destruction of Gazan infrastructure and statements by Israeli politicians that Gazans are "human animals"
and that Israel would deny them electricity, water, and medical care.[358][359][360]
On 26 January 2024, the ICJ issued a preliminary ruling finding that the rights asserted in South Africa's
filing were "plausible", and an order requiring that Israel take all measures in its power to prevent acts of
genocide, prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and allow basic humanitarian services into
Gaza.[47][361] Judge ad hoc Aharon Barak dissented from the majority's view that genocide-related rights
were "plausible", writing that South Africa had not demonstrated genocidal intent on Israel's part.[362]
On 15 May 2024, a report by the University Network for Human Rights, Boston University School of
Law, Cornell Law School, University of Pretoria, and the Yale Law School found that "Israel has
committed genocidal acts".[332][363] In a May 2024 interview, Human Rights Watch co-founder Aryeh
Neier detailed how Israel's blocking of aid and the subsequent starvation of Gaza's population is
indicative of genocide.[364]
On 1 June 2024, professor of international law Daniel-Erasmus Khan said there was no clear evidence of
a special intent among Israeli leadership.[365] A June 2024 report by the University Network for Human
Rights and Boston University School of Law found that "Israel has committed genocidal acts".[332] In an
August 2024 op-ed, Eli Rosenbaum, a lawyer and former director of the United States Department of
Justice's Office of Special Investigations, wrote that Israel's actions in Gaza were not genocidal since it
was aiming to "prevent genocide" by Hamas.[366]
In October 2024, Professor Conor Gearty called Israel genocidal, pointing to the continued attacks on
schools and hospitals and the lack of internal investigations by Israeli authorities into potential
crimes.[367] Some scholars, particularly those associated with Third World approaches to international
law, have argued that the international community's failure to treat Israel's actions in Gaza as genocide
and respond accordingly has harmed the principles of the international order and international law itself,
and exposed the deficiencies of international governance.[368][369][370] José Manuel Barreto argues that
"the Palestinian genocide has unveiled the deep colonial structure of the international legal order" and
identifies events in Gaza with the history of genocides in the colonised world, which he says the
Westphalian system has historically failed to prevent.[369]
In December 2024, Amnesty International published a report accusing Israel of committing
genocide.[371][372][373] After the Amnesty report, Human Rights Watch also said Israel had committed
"genocidal acts" and that Israeli officials statements may indicate genocidal intent.[374]
In April 2025, the barrister Michael Mansfield said there was "no question" that genocide was
occurring.[375] In May 2025, Luigi Daniele, a lecturer at Nottingham Law School, noted a link between
the IDF's justification for its conduct in Gaza and the Rapid Support Forces rationale in the Sudanese
civil war, saying it "reveals the emergence of a template to commit mass extermination and even
genocide".[376] In May 2024 the scholar Nimer Sultany supported Forensic Architecture's assessment that
Israel had weaponised international humanitarian law into "humanitarian violence".[377] This was
supported in July by Professor Neve Gordon and the anthropologist Nicola Perugini, who argued that
Israel used "the law itself as a tool legitimizing genocide".[378]
In June 2025, Ambos and scholar Stefanie Bock wrote that it has become more difficult to deny genocidal
intent.[379]
In July 2025, 1,300 professionals and academics in public health, health care, and the social sciences
signed a letter acknowledging the Gaza genocide.[380] According to professor Ernesto Verdeja, even by
"the most inflexible interpretation of genocide, Gaza qualifies as genocidal".[381] In July 2025, Le Monde
reported that legal experts remained divided on the question, with some agreeing that Israel was
committing genocide and others viewing the charge as unsubstantiated.[59] Bartov wrote that the silence
of many scholars of the Holocaust and Holocaust commemoration institutions and their disbelief that
Israel could commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, or genocide threatens
universalist interpretations of Holocaust studies and Holocaust commemoration and may lead to a decline
in the relevance of Holocaust education.[382][383] Journalist Colin Jones interviewed lawyers affiliated
with the US military and concluded that they see Gaza as a test case for what military conduct might be
acceptable in a hypothetical war between the US and a peer power such as China.[384]
In August 2025, according to Mia Swart, a growing consensus was emerging "in international legal
circles that Israel is committing genocide".[385] Craig Mokhiber, a retired UN human rights lawyer,
wrote, "Never, in the modern era, have we seen such a clear-cut, article-by-article violation of the United
Nations Genocide Convention, so broad a consensus in the identification of the crime".[386]
Other scholars
In March 2024, the Middle East Studies Association condemned the "accelerating scale of genocidal
violence being inflicted on the Palestinian population of Gaza", saying that Israel's conduct constituted
cultural genocide.[387] Surveys of 758 Middle East scholars by the Brookings Institution indicated a
growing consensus that Israel's military campaign in Gaza was genocide.[388][389][330]
In 2025, John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute at the United States
Military Academy, argued that Israel had not demonstrated genocidal intent, based on what he called
"evidence of what Israel is doing to preserve infrastructure, civilian life, to provide services".[390]
Robert Satloff of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy criticized the IAGS genocide resolution
for its sourcing and for lacking independent research, noting that it passed with the support of "only one-
fifth ... of the organization’s membership", though he wrote that his "critique of the IAGS resolution
should not be misread as endorsement of Israeli strategy and tactics in Gaza or indifference to the terrible
human toll in this conflict".[391]
Legal proceedings
International Court of Justice application
In December 2023, South Africa instituted proceedings at the
International Court of Justice pursuant to the Genocide
Convention, accusing Israel of committing genocide, war
crimes, and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in
Gaza.[392][46][393] South African president Cyril Ramaphosa
compared Israel's actions to apartheid.[394] Several
international organisations and other nations supported South
Stances of states on South Africa v.
Africa's suit.[395][396]
Israel:
South Africa
In its application, South Africa argued that Israel's actions
Countries that have supported South
"are genocidal in character because they are intended to bring
Africa's case
about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian
Countries that have opposed South
national, racial and ethnical group".[46][397] South Africa Africa's case
requested that the ICJ issue an interim order requiring Israel Israel
to "immediately suspend its military operations in and against
Gaza".[46][397]
On 26 January 2024, the ICJ issued a preliminary ruling finding that the rights asserted in South Africa's
filing were "plausible" and issued an order requiring that Israel take all measures in its power to prevent
acts of genocide, prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and allow basic humanitarian services into
Gaza.[47][361] Later that year, South Africa asked the ICJ to order additional measures against Israel,[398]
and in May, the court issued what some experts considered to be an ambiguous order but which was
widely understood as requiring Israel to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah.[399] Israel rejected this
interpretation and continued its offensive.[50]
The Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy rejected the allegations "with disgust"[393] and accused
South Africa of cooperating with Hamas,[392] calling South Africa's claims "blood libel".[400] On 2
January 2024, Israel decided to appear before the ICJ in response to South Africa's case, despite a history
of ignoring international tribunals.[397] On 13 January, Netanyahu said, "No one will stop us. Not The
Hague, not the Axis of Evil, no one."[401] Israeli officials accused the court of antisemitic bias.[402][403]
Israel asserted that that it had taken all possible measures to safeguard civilians during its military
campaign in Gaza.[404][405] Some left-wing Israeli politicians, including Ofer Cassif, supported South
Africa's case.[406]
International Court of Justice Vice President Julia Sebutinde was one of the 17 judges ruling on
provisional measures in South Africa's genocide case against Israel. She voted against all the provisional
measures, and was the only permanent judge to vote against any of the measures.[407][408] In her
dissenting opinion, Sebutinde wrote, "multiple concrete actions were taken by Israel to facilitate the
provision of humanitarian aid for the civilian population of Gaza."[409]
International Criminal Court
In May 2024, Khan applied for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Minister of
Defence Yoav Gallant, saying he had reasonable grounds to believe they bore criminal responsibility for
war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza.[410] The list of crimes did not include
genocide, which is legally distinct from extermination.[411] The warrants were issued in November
2024.[247]
As part of a December 2024 report accusing Israel of genocide, Amnesty International called on the ICC
"to urgently consider the commission of the crime of genocide by Israeli officials since 7 October 2023 in
the ongoing investigation into the situation in the State of Palestine".[412][413] Also in December 2024, the
Israeli law professor Omer Shatz filed a complaint with the ICC naming eight Israeli political and media
figures he believed were responsible for incitement to genocide.[414] On 1 October 2025, a complaint was
filed with the ICC accusing Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and other officials of genocide for
their support of Israel.[415][416] The US and Israel have politically pressured and imposed sanctions on the
ICC due to its positions during the war.[417]
Other proceedings
In November 2023, the Center for Constitutional Rights sued US President Joe Biden, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken, and Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin,[418][419][87] alleging that Israel's "mass killings",
targeting of civilian infrastructure, and forced expulsions amount to genocide,[143][418] and that the US
was capable of deterring Israel from committing these acts due to the countries' close relationship.[143] A
federal judge dismissed the case in January 2024, ruling that the US Constitution prevented his court
from determining foreign policy, but writing that "as the ICJ has found, it is plausible that Israel's conduct
amounts to genocide".[420] The judge also commented that he would have preferred to have issued the
injunction and urged Biden to rethink US policy.[421][422][418]
In February 2024, lawyers representing Palestinians in Germany filed a criminal complaint against
politicians including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Economic Minister
Robert Habeck, and Finance Minister Christian Lindner for "aiding and abetting" genocide in
Gaza.[423][424] The Public Prosecutor General dismissed the complaint due to lack of reasonable
suspicion.[425] The lawyers filed a similar complaint against current and former German government
members in September 2025.[425][426]
In March 2024, the Nicaraguan government initiated proceedings against Germany at the ICJ under the
Genocide Convention concerning Germany's support for Israel in the Gaza war.[427][428] It sought
provisional measures of protection, including resumption of suspended German funding of the UNRWA
and cessation of military supplies to Israel.[428]
In March 2024, Birchgrove Legal referred Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Foreign Minister
Penny Wong, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, and others to the ICC as accessories to genocide, war
crimes, and crimes against humanity, citing the defunding of UNRWA, the provision of military aid, and
"unequivocal political support" for Israel's actions during the Gaza war.[429][430]
In November 2025, the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Turkey issued arrest warrants for 37 Israeli
suspects on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. Officials named in the Turkish indictment
included Netanyahu, security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, defence minister Israel Katz (who had replaced
Gallant), and IDF chief of staff Eyal Zamir.[431]
Responsibility of third states and other entities
All UN states that are signatories to the Genocide Convention are obliged "to employ all means
reasonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide so far as possible" and must not provide "means
to enable or facilitate the commission of the crime".[432] Multiple scholars argue that the inaction of the
international community to confirmed atrocities in Gaza expose the irrelevance and weakness of the
Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine.[433][434][435] Many Western countries, especially the United
States, Germany, and the United Kingdom, have supported Israel by offering diplomatic, military, and
intelligence support.[436]
The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Palestine said, "States may be complicit in
failing to prevent genocide if they do not act in compliance" with the International Court of Justice's
orders or if they directly aid or assist in "the commission of genocide".[437] Other journalists and scholars
have written that the actions of the US and other Western countries implicitly give permission for
genocide.[438][439] In January 2024, the former UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness said that the US
and UK are complicit in genocide against Gaza.[440] In March Oxfam released a statement detailing its
intention, alongside several other non-governmental organisations,[m] to sue Denmark to prevent arms
sales to Israel, warning that by selling arms Denmark is "complicit in violations of international
humanitarian law ... and a plausible genocide".[441][442]
UN Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory chair Navi Pillay has said that states
that provide weapons to Israel, including the US, are complicit in genocide.[443] A UN Special Committee
wrote, "Failing to act now ... will tear apart the very foundation of the international rule of law we have
collectively built to protect peace, security, and the well-being of all. Our inaction today is setting a
perilous precedent for tomorrow."[17]
United States
The United States has been a key provider of diplomatic and
material support before and during the Gaza war.[444][445] It
pays for around 15% of Israel's military budget and is its
largest supplier of arms; it provided more than $22.8 billion
to the war effort in its first year.[446] According to the Quincy
Institute, the destruction of Gaza is "in large part, the result of
unconditional U.S. assistance and diplomatic cover".[447]
Pro-Palestine rally in Austin, Texas,
Both the Biden and Trump administrations have denied
United States, 2023
genocide in Gaza;[448] Biden's support of Israel earned him
the nickname "Genocide Joe".[449] In February 2025, Trump
proposed an American takeover of Gaza and displacing the people living there, though he no longer
supports this.[448] According to an August opinion poll, half of US voters believe Israel is committing
genocide in Gaza and 60% oppose further military assistance.[450] Six members of the US Congress have
recognised the genocide: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Summer Lee, Marjorie Taylor
Greene, Becca Balint and Bernie Sanders.[451]
United Kingdom
The British government does not give weapons to Israel
directly but rather issues licences for British companies to sell
them.[452] On 12 December 2023 Human Rights Watch said
that selling weapons to Israel could make the UK complicit in
war crimes. UK law says licences cannot be granted when
there is a clear risk the items might be used to commit or
facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian
law.[453] James Denselow of Save the Children UK said, "By
failing to push for a permanent end to the fighting or speak
out against the weaponisation of aid, Rishi Sunak and his
government are complicit in the horror that is unfolding."[454]

genocide
In April 2024, Guy Goodwin-Gill, a professor of international
law at Oxford University, said: "There is a serious risk of genocide, as the International Court of Justice
has found. If the UK, with that knowledge in mind, carries on exporting arms to Israel, there is a risk that
those arms will be used in the conduct of aggressive activities and in the conduct of genocide."[456] The
same month, hundreds of lawyers and legal academics published a legal opinion warning that the
government risked complicity in genocide by continuing to arm Israel.[457][458]
On 2 September 2024, Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced he was suspending approximately 30
arms export licences to Israel after a government review concluded there was a high risk these exports
were being used for severe violations of international humanitarian law.[459] At the time of the
suspension, Israel had around 350 arms export licences in the UK.[460]
On 3 September 2025, the Scottish Government announced a ban on funding to "arms companies whose
products or services are provided to countries where there is plausible evidence of genocide being
committed", including Israel.[461] The Scottish Parliament also voted for a boycott of Israel and any
companies providing it military support.[462]
Lawsuit over export licences
The human rights groups Al-Haq and Global Legal Action Network took legal action against the British
government in December 2023, saying that the government risked violating the Genocide Convention by
granting export licences for the sale of military equipment to Israel.[463]
In May 2025, a hearing began at the High Court of Justice to determine whether the UK had violated
arms export control laws by continuing to supply Israel with components for F-35 fighter jets even after
other licences were suspended. At the hearing, government lawyers argued that UK-made parts enter a
global spares pool rather than being shipped directly to Israel, where it is "generally not possible to
determine who the end user would be" and that suspending them "would have a critical impact on
international peace and security, including NATO's defence and deterrence".[464][465]
On 30 June 2025, the court dismissed the claim, holding the "F-35 carve out" lawful; it added that some
aspects of the challenge were "not for a domestic court to decide" and that the carve-out's "true nature"
was that the UK would "not cease to participate in the F-35 Programme", even though some UK
components would ultimately reach Israel.[466]
Germany
In October 2023, political analyst Lena Obermaier argued that Germany is complicit in Israel's war
crimes against Gaza.[467] She detailed how most of Germany's most prominent news outlets have "been
silent on Israeli genocidal policies". She also highlighted police suppression of pro-Palestine protests[468]
as evidence of state complicity.[467] According to Germany's Federal Commissioner for the Fight against
Antisemitism, accusing Israel of genocide is antisemitic.[469] Publicly accusing Israel of genocide can
lead to arrest in Germany, even when the accusers are Jewish or Israeli.[470][471] In February 2024 a
criminal complaint was filed in German courts accusing various senior politicians of complicity in
genocide.[423] In March, Nicaragua sued Germany for complicity at the ICJ.[427]
European Union
The European Union was accused of potential complicity after it did not suspend the EU-Israel
Association Agreement. Secretary General of Amnesty International Agnès Callamard said the EU was
giving Israel a "green light" to continue its genocide and was at "risk of complicity in Israel's
actions".[472][473] The Rights Forum said the decision was "shameless complicity in genocide".[474]
Egypt
Egypt has been accused of complicity in genocide for its enforcement of the blockade on Gaza and
refusal to open the Rafah Border Crossing.[475][476] In April 2025, Cage and five other African advocacy
organisations filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.[477] Egypt
is not permitted to turn people away at its borders if doing so would expose them to life-threatening
conditions or collective punishment, as this would violate its obligations under the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture.[478][479] Egypt was also accused of
complicity with Israel for its crackdown on the Global March to Gaza.[480]
Egypt has said that its closure of the Rafah crossing is done in opposition to Israeli plans to displace
Palestinians.[475] Egypt rejected an Israeli proposal for Gaza to be returned to Egypt for up to 15
years[481] and formally supported South Africa's genocide case against Israel.[482]
Italy
On 7 October 2025, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said in an interview with RAI – Radiotelevisione
italiana that a pro-Palestinian advocacy group had reported her, Defence Minister Guido Crosetto,
Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, and Leonardo director Roberto Cingolani to the International Criminal
Court for alleged complicity in the genocide.[483][484] The complaint, which was signed by 50 people,
including law professors, lawyers, and several public figures, was filed on 1 October. It accused Meloni's
government of complicity for supplying arms to Israel and urged the ICC to evaluate whether a formal
investigation into the allegation could be initiated.[485] As of May 2025, Italy was the third-largest
supplier of weaponry to Israel, representing around 1% of Israel's weaponry imports.[486][487] Despite the
Italian government's claims that weaponry supplement to Israel had been interrupted, Leonardo, one of
Italy's biggest arms companies, confirmed that the Italian government and Italian companies still export
arms to Israel.[488] Francesca Albanese directly called Italy an accomplice in the Gaza genocide.[489]
Private sector and media
Multiple corporations have been accused of profiting from the Gaza genocide.[490][491] Executives from
Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and RTX Corporation have described the war in Gaza as a source
of increased profits.[492][493]
On 20 June 2024, UN experts warned that continued arms transfers to Israel could amount to violations of
international law and risk state and corporate complicity in potential genocide. They called for an
immediate halt to all weapons transfers to Israel, including by such major arms manufacturers as BAE
Systems, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Caterpillar. They also warned institutions investing in these
companies, such as Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo.[494]
In June 2025, a UN expert's report named Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM as "central to Israel's
surveillance apparatus and the ongoing Gaza destruction", and Palantir as a source of AI tools for the
Israeli military.[495] The report also named Allianz, Barclays, BlackRock, and BNP Paribas for
underwriting and purchasing Israeli government bonds, which the UN said are the main source of
financing for Israel's military expenditures.[496] Scholars, journalists, media analysts and human rights
advocates have accused various media outlets of complicity through media imperialism.[497]
Political discourse
World leaders and governments
Several Western governments (notably
the United States, United Kingdom,
and Germany) reject calling Israel's
actions in Gaza a
genocide.[498][499][500] Belgium,
Norway, and Canada have said they
will abide by or await the ICJ's
judgment rather than take a definitive
stance.[501][502][503]
A large group of states, especially in
Positions of national governments on whether Israel is committing
the Islamic world, most of Africa, genocide in the Gaza war
Latin America, and some European Agree
countries, explicitly describe Israel's Disagree
actions as genocide and/or have joined Unclear
or supported South Africa's ICJ Defer to the ruling in the ICJ case South Africa v. Israel
case.[504] These include Ghana,[505] No data
Turkey,[506] Malaysia,[507] Egypt,[508]
Brazil,[509] Chile,[510] Colombia,[511]
Spain,[512] Ireland,[513] and Slovenia.[514] On November 7, 2025, Turkey issued arrest warrants for
genocide against Netanyahu and 36 colleagues.[515]
The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Arab League, and the African Union have
collectively endorsed the characterisation of Israel's actions as genocide and called for accountability and
measures such as ending arms transfers.[516] In January 2025, the Hague Group convened in Bogotá with
the aim to uphold international rulings on Gaza, end arms shipments to Israel and build a pathway to
broader recognition of Palestinian statehood.[517]
Non-governmental organisations and intergovernmental organisations
Numerous non-governmental organisations and intergovernmental organisations have accused Israel of
genocide. Among the first to warn of a risk of genocide, in mid-October 2023, were Genocide Watch and
the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention.[518][519] Several Palestinian human rights groups,
including Defence for Children International (DCI),[520] Al-Haq, Al Mezan, and the Palestinian Centre
for Human Rights, have filed lawsuits alleging a genocide.[521] Some Israeli human rights organisations,
such as B'Tselem[522] and Physicians for Human Rights–Israel, released reports calling Israel's campaign
in Gaza a genocide.[23][523][524] International human rights groups condemning Israel's genocide include
the International Federation for Human Rights,[24] Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor,[525]
Amnesty International,[412][526][20] the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights,[527] and
Human Rights Watch.[266] In October 2024, Oxfam and 37 other humanitarian organisations warned that
Israel was failing to comply with the Genocide Convention as it wiped Northern Gaza "off the map".[528]
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has also found that Israel is committing genocide.[529][530][531] The
American activist group Jewish Voice for Peace has stated that Israel is committing
genocide.[532][533][534]
In September 2025, the UN Human Rights Council's Independent International Commission of Inquiry
issued a report concluding that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The
Commission found reasonable grounds to determine that Israeli authorities and security forces have
committed, and continue to commit, four of the five genocidal acts defined under the 1948 Genocide
Convention: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting
conditions of life calculated to bring about the group's physical destruction in whole or in part; and
imposing measures intended to prevent births.[16][535]
Cultural discourse
Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza has been a contentious topic in cultural discourse.
Celebrities, athletes, public intellectuals, activists, cultural institutions and ordinary people have weighed
in on the events in Gaza, as well as on the cultural and societal implications of viewing those events
through the framework of genocide.[536]
Public opinion in Israel and abroad
Multiple surveys have found broad support among Jewish Israelis for the government's policies toward
Gaza.[537][538][539] An August 2025 Accord Center poll found that 76% of Jewish Israelis agreed with the
statement "there are no innocent people in Gaza".[540] A May 2025 survey found that 82% supported
expelling Gazans, while 56% favoured also expelling Palestinians from Israel.[537] Another August 2025
poll found that 79% of Jewish Israelis were untroubled by reports of famine in Gaza.[538] According to
the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention, "the vast majority of Israelis agree with...[Israel's] plan and
clearly will support anything to see it realized – from apartheid to extermination."[541]
A September 2025 AP-NORC poll found that the number of Americans who believe that Israel's military
actions in Gaza have "gone too far" was increasing.[542]
Impact
British sociologist Martin Shaw has called the Gaza genocide "the genocide that changed the world"
because of mass mobilisation against genocide. He also highlights some political victories by Israel, but
"at huge cost to its global legitimacy and that of the West".[544] Israeli journalist and author Gideon Levy
wrote an article in Haaretz insisting that the people of Gaza will never forget the massacres,
bombardments, destruction, and trauma.[545]
Some scholars, particularly those associated with Third World
approaches to international law, have argued that the
international community's failure to treat Israel's actions in
Gaza as a genocide and respond accordingly has harmed the
principles of the international order and international law and
exposed the deficiencies of international
governance.[368][369][370] José Manuel Barreto argues that
"the Palestinian genocide has unveiled the deep colonial
structure of the international legal order", placing the Gaza
Millions of people around the world
genocide in a long list of colonial genocides the international
protested Israel's actions, many of them
system has tolerated.[369] Mark LeVine argues that Israel's
explicitly calling for the recognition and
actions have destroyed respect for international law and cessation of genocide.[543]
weakened the taboo against large-scale violence in response
to perceived threats.[546] Dutch lawyer and professor of
international law André Nollkaemper has said that the United States' rejection of international law is a
unique feature of the Gaza war.[547] The journalist Colin Jones interviewed lawyers affiliated with the US
military and concluded that they see Gaza as a test case for what military conduct might be acceptable in
a hypothetical war between the US and a peer power such as China.[384]

a. This start date is the beginning of the war. Sources disagree on when the genocide started,
see Background.
b. Overall deaths since October 7th per the Gaza Health Ministry,[5] which has been deemed
[6][7][8][9]
reliable by independent organisations. The Ministry's public totals are aggregate and
include both civilians and combatants.[9][10]
c. Amnesty International,[20] Médecins Sans Frontières,[21] B'Tselem,[22] Physicians for Human
[23] [24]
Rights–Israel, International Federation for Human Rights.
d. A small number of these deaths (it is unclear exactly how many) were a result of friendly fire,
including civilians killed by Israeli military fire while attempting to prevent their abduction by
armed Palestinians and combatants killed as a result of the Hannibal Directive.[78][79][80]
There are up to 15 known civilian deaths from these causes: up to 13 in Be'eri, one from
helicopter gunfire on a vehicle carrying a hostage,[81] and one in Kibbutz Alumim.[82]
According to Ynet, there was an "immense and complex quantity" of friendly-fire incidents
on the part of IDF during the 7 October attack, accounting for a fifth of the 105 military
[83]
deaths then recorded.

f. Per the Gaza Health Ministry and Government Information Office by 3 January 2024, over
22,300 people had been confirmed dead.[166]
g. 47.4% were non-elderly men, 30.7% were children, 17.1% were non-elderly women, 3.0%
were elderly men and 1.9% were elderly women.
h. In the original Hebrew article the Haaretz reporter used the term "Extermination Zones"
(הדמשהה יחטש, Shtachei Hashmada)[183] instead of the English version term "Kill Zone".
i. Per the IPC manual, the starvation death rate does not necessarily have to be that high
(does not have to be at least 2 deaths per 10,000 people per day) to declare catastrophic
(level 5) food insecurity. However, it does need to be that high to declare famine.
j. Some Israeli officials denied the plan had been adopted; however, an official familiar with
[239]
the situation stated that some aspects of the plan were already in progress.
k. The use of white phosphorus against military targets located among civilians is contrary to
Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, of which Israel is not a
signatory.[304]
l. Article II of the Genocide Convention defines genocide as "any of the following acts
committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious
group" through acts such as (a) murder, (b) inflicting serious bodily or mental harm, (c)
inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy the group, (d) imposing measures intended
to prevent births, and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.[327]

20. Amnesty International report 2024, p. 13: "This report focuses on the Israeli authorities'
policies and actions in Gaza as part of the military offensive they launched in the wake of
the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 while situating them within the broader context of
Israel's unlawful occupation, and system of apartheid against Palestinians in Gaza, the West
Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. It assesses allegations of violations and crimes
under international law by Israel in Gaza within the framework of genocide under
international law, concluding that there is sufficient evidence to believe that Israel's conduct
in Gaza following 7 October 2023 amounts to genocide."
21. Médecins Sans Frontières 2025: "Our decision to describe what's happening in Gaza as a
'genocide' is based on nearly two years of extensive, firsthand information from our teams,
who are witnessing massive levels of death and destruction by Israeli forces, a campaign of
ethnic cleansing and the almost total dismantling of the health care system."
22. B'Tselem 2025, p. 86: "The review presented in this report leaves no room for doubt: since
October 2023, the Israeli regime has been responsible for carrying out genocide against the
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Killing tens of thousands of people; causing bodily or mental
harm to hundreds of thousands more; destroying homes and civilian infrastructure on a
massive scale; starvation, displacement, and denying humanitarian aid—all this is being
perpetrated systematically, as part of a coordinated attack aimed at annihilating all facets of
life in the Gaza Strip."

the severity and urgency of the situation, this article sought to show that there is an
emerging consensus that Israel's actions in Gaza are not another instance of armed
conflict but instead amount to genocide"
Swart 2025, p. 3: "South Africa's actions led to an ever-growing consensus in
international legal circles that Israel is committing genocide"
Lederman 2025, p. 1: "Roughly since mid-2024, there seems to have emerged a broad
agreement among genocide scholars—at least those who have expressed their views
on the matter—that this is indeed the case ... What followed seems to be a similar broad
agreement emerging among legal scholars that this is indeed a genocide, and even
those who are still hesitating find the genocide charges much more convincing."
Shaw 2025b, p. 3: "By the end of 2024, when Amnesty International published a
comprehensively evidenced and legally argued case,17 the consensus that Israel was
committing genocide was becoming overwhelming"
Gessen 2024: "Trachtenberg testified to a consensus opinion among historians of
genocide that what is happening in Gaza can indeed be called a genocide, largely
because the intent to cause death on a massive scale has been so clear in the
statements of Israeli officials"
Bouranova 2024: "The opposition is political, as there is consensus amongst the
international human rights legal community, many other legal and political experts,
including many Holocaust scholars, that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza."

supremacy of one group over another is an apartheid regime. Israeli apartheid, which
promotes the supremacy of Jews over Palestinians, was not born in one day or of a single
speech. It is a process that has gradually grown more institutionalized and explicit, with
mechanisms introduced over time in law and practice to promote Jewish supremacy. These
accumulated measures, their pervasiveness in legislation and political practice, and the
public and judicial support they receive—all form the basis for our conclusion that the bar for
labeling the Israeli regime as apartheid has been met."

statements made by Israeli officials contain dehumanising sentiments that encourage
hatred toward Palestinians and violence against Palestinians and are consistent with the
pattern of conduct...that point to an intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a group.
The Commission considers that these statements by Israeli officials are reasonably
interpreted as statements expressing an intent to destroy the Palestinian group in Gaza
and they have been acted on as such by Israeli security forces in the Gaza Strip. They
are direct evidence of dolus specialis."
Amnesty International report 2024, pp. 26–35: "Bearing in mind that...the othering and
dehumanization of the protected group and that the use of derogatory language...can
provide evidence of genocidal intent, Amnesty International examined Israeli officials'
use of dehumanizing, racist and derogatory rhetoric against Palestinians.... It reviewed
102 statements made by Israeli government officials, high-ranking military officers and
members of the Knesset made between 7 October 2023 and 30 June 2024 which
dehumanized Palestinians, or called for, or justified, genocidal acts or other crimes
under international law against them."
Kulkarni 2023: "Army's spokesperson Daniel Hagari, who bragged of dropping
'thousands of tons of munitions'...had no qualms admitting that 'we're focused on what
causes maximum damage', rather than 'accuracy'. Referring to Palestinians as 'human
animals', Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who prided in having 'released all the restraints'
on the military, had said in the early days of the war that 'we will eliminate everything' in
Gaza...Legitimizing the mass killing of civilians in Gaza, Israeli President Isaac Herzog
had declared that 'an entire nation out there is responsible' for the October 7 attack on
Israel by Hamas, arguing that the 'rhetoric' about innocent civilians is 'absolutely not
true.'... 'This practice of casting an entire population as enemies, as legitimate military
targets, is a common genocidal mechanism,' Raz Segal, a prominent Jewish Israeli
scholar of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, said in his remarks at the panel discussion."
120. Gessen 2024.
121. Al-Waheidi 2025: "Fyfe, the Washington and Lee University legal scholar, said,
'Genocide can occur within or outside of war. But it is never permissible, even if the war
itself is. So war is not a defense...If a military leader intends to gain land and removing a
group is the only way to do it, that's not necessarily genocide. But if the only reasonable
inference from a siege or campaign is that the group itself is being destroyed as such,
then that is genocidal intent...I do not think it is reasonable to claim that the siege is a
military objective, given that Hamas is already crippled.""

imposed on Palestinians in Gaza following 7 October 2023 indicates that the destruction of

total siege on Gaza on 9 October 2023...fully aware that this would necessarily cause and
exacerbate malnutrition, hunger, the outbreak of multiple diseases and, ultimately, bring

129. Lederman 2025, p. 2: "The case of Gaza...shows us again why the meaning of intent in the
Genocide Convention should be reinterpreted...to include the foreseeable consequences of
a given policy when its meaning is the genocidal destruction of a group or a severe harm to
it as a group—a knowledge-based rather than purpose-based concept of genocide. Such a
concept points to...moving away from the focus on obscure mental states of individual
perpetrators to the collective process that leads to genocide."

133. Amnesty International report 2024, p. 35: "The evidence presented in the report clearly
shows that the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza, as such, was Israel's intent—either in
addition to or as a means to achieve its military aims. There is only one reasonable
inference that can be drawn from the evidence presented: genocidal intent has been part
and parcel of Israel's conduct in Gaza since 7 October 2023, including its military
campaign."
134. UN Commission of Inquiry report 2025, p. 64: "On the basis of fully conclusive evidence, the
Commission finds that statements made by Israeli authorities are direct evidence of
genocidal intent. Additionally, on the basis of circumstantial evidence, the Commission finds
that genocidal intent was the only reasonable inference that could be drawn, based on the
pattern of conduct of the Israeli authorities. Thus, the Commission concludes that the Israeli
authorities and Israeli security forces have the genocidal intent to destroy, in whole or in
part, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip."

171. Khatib, McKee & Yusuf 2024: "Armed conflicts have indirect health implications beyond the
direct harm from violence. Even if the conflict ends immediately, there will continue to be
many indirect deaths in the coming months and years from causes such as reproductive,
communicable, and non-communicable diseases. The total death toll is expected to be large
given the intensity of this conflict; destroyed health-care infrastructure; severe shortages of
food, water, and shelter; the population's inability to flee to safe places; and the loss of
funding to UNRWA, one of the very few humanitarian organisations still active in the Gaza
Strip. In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of
direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death
to the 37,396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186,000 or even
more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip
population estimate of 2,375,259, this would translate to 7.9% of the total population in the
Gaza Strip."

injuries, wars cause "indirect deaths" by destroying, damaging, or causing deterioration of

describes the causal pathways that can be expected to lead to far larger numbers of indirect
deaths. These deaths result from diseases and other population-level health effects that
stem from war's destruction of public infrastructure and livelihood sources, reduced access
to water and sanitation, environmental damage, and other such factors. This report builds on
a foundation of previous Costs of War research for its framework and methodology in
covering the most significant chains of impact, or causal pathways, to indirect war deaths in
Gaza and the West Bank. Unlike in combat, these deaths do not necessarily occur
immediately or in the close aftermath of the battles which many observers focus on. While it
will take years to assess the full extent of these population-level health effects, they will
inevitably lead to far higher numbers of deaths than direct violence."

the future conception of Palestinians. The Commission did not find any evidence that this
IVF clinic was a legitimate military target at the time that it was attacked by the ISF. The
Commission concludes that the destruction of the Basma IVF clinic was a measure intended
to prevent births among Palestinians in Gaza, which is a genocidal act under the Rome

the intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, in whole or in part, and that this is
